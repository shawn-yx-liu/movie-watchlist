# Movie Watchlist
The movie watchlist is a program that allows users to search for a movie and add it to their watchlist, using the OMDB API.  I created this project as a way to practice my asynchronous JavaScript and API skills.  

## Getting Started
### Build and Run the program:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````

### Usage
* Search for a movie by its title using the centered search bar.
* Click the "+" button to add the movie to your watchlist, or the "-" button to remove the movie from your watchlist.
* Click "My Watchlist" in the header to navigate to your watchlist.
